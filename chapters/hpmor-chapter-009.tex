Harry glanced over briefly to look at his new House-mate, more to get a quick look at the face than anything else. He was still trying to get himself under control from his encounter with the ghosts. The sad, the really sad, the really truly sad thing was that he \emph{did} seem to be getting himself under control again. It seemed ill-fitting. Like he should have taken at least a day. Maybe a whole lifetime. Maybe just never.

“Finnigan, Seamus!”

There was a long, tense moment of silence under the Hat. Almost a minute. Hermione, next to him, was shifting from side to side, fidgeting so energetically that Harry thought her feet might be leaving the floor.

\shout{“Gryffindor!”}

“Granger, Hermione!”

Hermione broke loose and ran full tilt toward the Sorting Hat, picked it up and jammed the patchy old clothwork down hard over her head. Harry winced. Hermione had been the one to explain to \emph{him} about the Sorting Hat, but she certainly didn’t \emph{treat} it like an irreplaceable, vitally important, 800-year-old artifact of forgotten magic that was about to perform intricate telepathy on her mind and didn’t seem to be in very good physical condition.

\shout{“Ravenclaw!”}

And talk about your foregone conclusions. Harry didn’t really see why Hermione had been so tense about it. In what weird alternative universe would that girl \emph{not} be Sorted into Ravenclaw? If Hermione Granger didn’t go to Ravenclaw then there was no good reason for Ravenclaw House to exist.

Hermione arrived at the Ravenclaw table and got a dutiful cheer; Harry wondered whether the cheer would have been louder, or quieter, if they’d had any idea just what level of competition they’d welcomed to their table. Harry knew pi out to 3.141592 because accuracy to one part in a million was enough for most practical purposes. Hermione knew one hundred digits of pi because that was how many digits had been printed in the back of her math textbook.

Neville Longbottom went to Hufflepuff, Harry was glad to see. If that House really did contain the loyalty and camaraderie it was supposed to exemplify, then a Houseful of reliable friends would do Neville a whole world of good. Smart kids in Ravenclaw, evil kids in Slytherin, wannabe heroes in Gryffindor, and everyone who does the actual work in Hufflepuff.

(Though Harry \emph{had} been right to consult a Ravenclaw prefect first. The young woman hadn’t even looked up from her reading or identified Harry, just jabbed a wand in Neville’s direction and muttered something. After which Neville had acquired a dazed expression and wandered off to the fifth car from the front and the fourth cabin on the left, which indeed had contained his toad.)

Draco went to Slytherin, and Harry breathed a small sigh of relief. It had \emph{seemed} like a sure thing, but you never did know what tiny event might upset the course of your master plan.

They were approaching the Ps now...

And over at the Gryffindor table, there was a whispered conversation.

\emph{“What if he doesn’t like it?”}

\emph{“He’s got no right to not like it—}

\emph{“—not after the prank he played on—”}

\emph{“—Neville Longbottom, his name was—”}

\emph{“—he’s as fair a fair target now as fair can be.”}

\emph{“All right. Just make sure you don’t forget your parts.”}

\emph{“We’ve rehearsed it often enough—”}

\emph{“—over the last three hours.”}

And Minerva McGonagall, from where she stood at the speaker’s podium of the Head Table, looked down at the next name on her list. \emph{Please don’t let him be a Gryffindor please don’t let him be a Gryffindor \shout{oh please} don’t let him be a Gryffindor...} She took a deep breath, and called:

“Potter, Harry!”

There was a sudden silence in the hall as all whispered conversation stopped.

A silence broken by a horrible buzzing noise that modulated and changed in hideous mockery of musical melody.

Minerva’s head jerked around, shocked, and identified the buzzing noise as coming from the Gryffindor direction, where They were \emph{standing on top of the table} blowing into some kind of tiny devices held against Their lips. Her hand started to drop to her wand, to \emph{Silencio} the lot of Them, but another sound stopped her.

Dumbledore was chuckling.

Minerva’s eyes went back to Harry Potter, who had only just started to step out of line before he’d stumbled and halted.

Then the young boy began to walk forward again, moving his legs in odd sweeping motions, and waving his arms back and forth and snapping his fingers, in synchrony with Their music.

\vspace{-4ex}\begin{verse}[\versewidth]

\shout{“Harry Potter!”} shouted Lee Jordan, and the Weasley twins performed a triumphant chorus.

\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
With a Killing Curse?\\*
Well it could be worse.\\*
Who you gonna call?
\end{verse}

\shout{“Harry Potter!”} There were a lot more voices shouting it this time.

The Weasley Horrors went off into an extended wailing, now accompanied by some of the older Muggleborns, who had produced their own tiny devices, Transfigured out of the school silverware no doubt. As their music reached its anticlimax, Harry Potter shouted:

\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
I ain’t afraid of Dark Lords!
\end{verse}

There was cheering then, especially from the Gryffindor table, and more students produced their own antimusical instruments. The hideous buzzings redoubled in volume and built to another awful crescendo:

\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
I ain’t afraid of Dark Lords!
\end{verse}

Minerva glanced to both sides of the Head Table, afraid to look but with all too good a notion of what she would see.

Trelawney frantically fanning herself, Flitwick looking on with curiosity, Hagrid clapping along to the music, Sprout looking severe, and Quirrell gazing at the boy with sardonic amusement. Directly to her left, Dumbledore humming along; and directly to her right, Snape gripping his empty wine goblet, white-knuckled, so hard that the thick silver was slowly deforming.

\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
Dark robes and a mask?\\*
Impossible task?\\*
Who you gonna call?\\*
\shout{“Harry Potter!”}

Giant Fire-Ape?\\*
Old bat in a cape?\\*
Who you gonna call?\\*
\shout{“Harry Potter!”}
\end{verse}

Minerva’s lips set in a white line. She would have words with Them about that last verse, if They thought she was powerless because it was the first day of school and Gryffindor had no points to take away. If They didn’t care about detentions then she would find something else.

Then, with a sudden gasp of horror, she looked in Snape’s direction, \emph{surely} he realized the Potter boy must have no idea who that was talking about—

Snape’s face had gone beyond rage into a kind of pleasant indifference. A faint smile played about his lips. He was looking in the direction of Harry Potter, not the Gryffindor table, and his hands held the crumpled remains of a former wine goblet...

And Harry walked forward, sweeping his arms and legs through the motions of the Ghostbusters dance, keeping a smile on his face. It was a great setup, had caught him completely by surprise. The least he could do was play along and not ruin it all.

Everyone was cheering him. It made him feel all warm inside and sort of awful at the same time.

They were cheering him for a job he’d done when he was one year old. A job he hadn’t really finished. Somewhere, somehow, the Dark Lord was still alive. Would they have been cheering quite so hard, if they knew that?

But the Dark Lord’s power \emph{had} been broken once.

And Harry would protect them again. If there was in fact a prophecy and that was what it said. Well, actually regardless of what any darn prophecy said.

All those people believing in him and cheering him—Harry couldn’t stand to let that be false. To flash and fade like so many other child prodigies. To be a disappointment. To fail to live up to his reputation as a symbol of the Light, never mind \emph{how} he’d gotten it. He would absolutely, positively, no matter how long it took and even if it killed him, fulfill their expectations. And then go on to \emph{exceed} those expectations, so that people wondered, looking back, that they had once asked so little of him.

And he shouted out the lie that he’d invented because it scanned well and the song called for it:

\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
I ain’t afraid of Dark Lords!\\*
I ain’t afraid of Dark Lords!
\end{verse}

Harry took his last steps forward to the Sorting Hat as the music ended. He swept a bow to the Order of Chaos at the Gryffindor table, and then turned and swept another bow to the other side of the hall, and waited for the applause and giggling to die away.

In the back of his mind, he wondered if the Sorting Hat was genuinely \emph{conscious} in the sense of being aware of its own awareness, and if so, whether it was satisfied with only getting to talk to eleven-year-olds once per year. Its song had implied so: \emph{Oh, I’m the Sorting Hat and I’m okay, I sleep all year and I work one day...}

When there was once more silence in the room, Harry sat on the stool and \emph{carefully} placed onto his head the 800-year-old telepathic artifact of forgotten magic.

Thinking, just as hard as he could: \emph{Don’t Sort me yet! I have questions I need to ask you! Have I ever been Obliviated? Did you Sort the Dark Lord when he was a child and can you tell me about his weaknesses? Can you tell me why I got the brother wand to the Dark Lord’s? Is the Dark Lord’s ghost bound to my scar and is that why I get so angry sometimes? Those are the most important questions, but if you’ve got another moment can you tell me anything about how to rediscover the lost magics that created you?}

Into the silence of Harry’s spirit, where before there had never been any voice but one, there came a second and unfamiliar voice, sounding distinctly worried:

\emph{“Oh, dear. This has never happened before...”}
